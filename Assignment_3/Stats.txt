What case study area did you pick and why?
I looked into whether there was a correlation between the percent of mixed race population and the percent of white people in census block groups.
I was interested in this because I think racial distribution is very tied to issues such as red lining and self segregation.
As our population gets more and more mixed, it is important to look at where these kinds of people are distributed.

What metrics did you pick and why?
I picked mixed population, white population, and total population. The first two metrics are what I am interested in
exploring, and the total population is used to normalize.

What statistical test did you use and why?
I used the Spearman's Rank Order Correlation. I thought this would be a good test to explore the strength and direction of a possible correlation between
the two variables.

What was it's result (again not graded for accuracy)?
-0.24494755
This means that the more white people in an area, the less likely it is for mixed people to be in that area (block group).
The range for the result is -1 - 1, so this is not a particularly strong correlation, but it does seem to be significant.
