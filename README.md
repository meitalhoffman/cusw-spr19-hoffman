## 11.S195 Computational Urban Science Workshop
### Meital Hoffman

This repo contains my classwork from Spring 2019 in the MIT course 11.S195 Computational Urban Science Workshop. 
The projects are written in Processing and JavaScript.
The point of the course was to gain experience visualizing urban data. \
The work consists of class assignments, a midterm assignment, and a final project. The **final** final project can be found at my [MITBathrooms] (https://github.com/meitalhoffman/MITBathrooms) repo.
