## 11.S195 Computational Urban Science Workshop
### Meital Hoffman

This repo contains my classwork from Spring 2019 in the MIT course 11.S195 Computational Urban Science Workshop. 
The projects are written in Processing and JavaScript.
The point of the course was to gain experience visualizing urban data. \
The work consists of class assignments, a midterm assignment, and a final project. My final project centered around the location of different gendered and non-gendered bathrooms on MIT's campus. I created a tool where you could place an avatar on a map of MIT's campus and the tool would route your avatar to the nearest men's, women's, and gender neutral bathroom. The project was meant to highlight the continued unequal access to bathroom facilities based on gender identity. Part of this problem is inherent in the building of MIT, which was first deisgned only to serve male students. Unfortunately, I ran out of time to debug and document the project properly, but it is high on my "work-to-revisit" list.
